;;; Coordinate-driven version of Talos 'Claustrophobia'.
;;; The fixed BEAM-VIA corridor remains authored, while raw planar geometry derives its
;;; finite-barrier crossings, the visibility tables, walking topology, and manipulation
;;; reach.  Jumping, climbing, and directional jamming exclusions remain explicitly authored
;;; because they are not determined by planar geometry alone.

  ;; Boundary wall.  The repeated final point explicitly closes the polygon.  tech/-beam-los-coordinates.lisp's
  ;; DERIVE-LOS-FROM-SEGMENTS retains each polygon crossing, so ordinary low sight outside
  ;; this silhouette is blocked exactly like an internal wall segment.
  ;; tech/-walkability-coordinates.lisp's own walking derivation folds it in the same way, so
  ;; walking across this silhouette is blocked too.

  ;; Opaque internal wall, interrupted by a visibility-transparent,
  ;; non-walkable window.  wall3 caps the notch shared with problem-corner-topo.lisp
  ;; (same segment declared there) so LOS/walkability derivations here see it too.
  ;; edge1 is the ground-level footprint of the raised slab that location12, location13,
  ;; gate8, and gate9 sit on (elevation 3/2): its east edge, between location12 and
  ;; location10, sealing against the boundary at y 10 and 17.  Walking across the slab
  ;; at ground level is thereby blocked on that side; the elevation-3/2 crossing
  ;; location12 <-> location13 lies entirely inside the footprint (gated by
  ;; gate8/gate9), and the level change onto the slab is the authored JUMPING edge
  ;; below.  This is EDGE, not WALL: it marks the vertical boundary between two
  ;; different-elevation regions rather than a freestanding linear partition.  Its
  ;; default height 3/2 spans that step for terrain and LOS checks, but EDGE is absent
  ;; from jump's vaultable-object type; the JUMPING edge below therefore crosses with an
  ;; empty feature list rather than treating edge1 as a vault barrier.
  ;;
  ;; The slab's west side, location13 <-> location11, carries no edge at all: it is
  ;; instead the authored STAIRWAY crossing below, unconditional in both directions
  ;; and blind to the elevation difference by design (tech/stairs.lisp).  With no edge
  ;; there, -walkability-coordinates.lisp's zone flood-fill merges location11 into the
  ;; slab's own 2D zone and derives a WALKING edge between them; that edge is inert --
  ;; walking-segment-for-clause's elevation-equality check always rejects it as a usable
  ;; WALK, since the two locations sit at different elevations -- so the STAIRWAY edge remains
  ;; the only way to actually cross.
