;;; Filename: -placement.lisp

;;; Placement substrate: where a carried object may be set down -- a plate, a floor-mounted
;;; fan, a fixed floor/angled blower, a clear box top, another agent's currently-held tray,
;;; or bare ground -- gated by CLEARTOP for the object being placed, and by the agent's
;;; placement reach, which bounds how far
;;; above the agent a resting place may be but never how far below it.  A support already
;;; carrying an occupant of the other recorder layer still counts as clear: the layers are
;;; superimposed, so a live box may be set down on a plate a ghost box already stands on.  A fan qualifies as
;;; a support only while mounted on gears: a loose fan is mere cargo, like a connector, and
;;; a wall-mounted fan has no has-location.  A fixed floor/angled blower exposes the same
;;; flush support surface through its fixed position.  A tray qualifies as a support only
;;; while held: grounded, it is inert, so only currently-held trays are ever offered.  Shared by every carried-object
;;; technology that must choose where a held object comes to rest: box, jammer, beam-relay,
;;; and a fan mounted on floor-gears.  Declared identically by each until now; this file owns it
;;; once.  Mounting a fan on gears is an attachment, not a support placement, so it is
;;; -gears-fan's own mount-fan action rather than a case here.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location
;;;   nested    : -vertical (top, location-elevation); -support-elevation
;;;               (within-agent-placement-reach); -support-occupancy
;;;               (support, on, cleartop); -location (has-location);
;;;               -position (has-position); -holding (cargo, holding);
;;;               -interaction-policy (object-manipulation-allowed,
;;;               support-use-allowed)
;;;   conditional relation:
;;;               mounted-on (-gears-fan), guarded by a DOALL over optional FAN;
;;;               a problem with fans must include a gears/fan technology
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   queries   : placement-choice-allowed -- shared policy gate used by both option
;;;               generation and the placement update
;;;               placement-options  --  legal plate/fan/fixed-blower/box/tray/ground
;;;               placements at a location, excluding a given object (?self) as a
;;;               candidate support; only a floor-mounted fan and only a currently-held
;;;               tray are ever offered
;;;               placement-elevation -- the resting base elevation produced by an option
;;;   update    : place-held-object!  --  releases ?agent's hold, sets ?object's location,
;;;               carries a tray's riders to that location and unloads them there, and
;;;               rests ?object on ?place unless ?place is 'ground
;;;   nested    : -configuration-transition, for relocate-tray-and-riders!.  That file is
;;;               where a held tray's stack is kept synced to its holder during movement;
;;;               the same rule has to hold when the tray is set down, so the two share one
;;;               relocation update rather than each carrying its own
