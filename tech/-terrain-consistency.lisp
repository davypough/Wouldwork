;;; Terrain-consistency substrate: cross-checks authored vertical facts against the walking
;;; arrangement -walkability-coordinates already derives.  It separates one geometric
;;; invariant from two topology-review policies.  The invariant runs automatically during
;;; walking initialization; TEST-TOPO applies the policies after staging each long-running
;;; topology problem.  All three ABSTAIN wherever the arrangement cannot settle the
;;; question -- an abstention is not a pass, it is the honest answer when the geometry names
;;; no level on one side of the thing being checked.
;;;
;;; A level STEP is the shared notion behind all three: an edge's grid interval flanks two
;;; cells, and when each flanking zone carries locations that agree on one level, and the
;;; two levels differ, that interval names a determinate step.  An edge whose intervals
;;; name no step, or more than one, settles nothing -- an edge running the length of a
;;; staircase separates no single pair of levels -- and every check below then leaves it
;;; alone.
;;;
;;;   Edge span.  An EDGE is the vertical surface between the two regions it separates, so
;;;   its BASE is the lower level of its step and its TOP the higher.
;;;
;;;   Edge traversability.  A step is only terrain if something can cross it.  An edge
;;;   naming a determinate step must have some level change joining a location in one of
;;;   its flanking zones to a location in the other -- otherwise the map has a wall the
;;;   author drew as a step.  Which pairs may cross is the author's choice, not the
;;;   geometry's: measured across the topology problems, one edge is crossed at exactly one
;;;   of the several location pairs whose line of centres passes through it.  So this asks
;;;   only that a crossing exist, never where.
;;;
;;;   Zone levels.  Locations in one zone are joined by derived WALKING edges, and
;;;   ONE-STEP-WALKABLE rejects every one of those that crosses a level change.  A zone
;;;   holding more than one level is therefore walking-disconnected across that
;;;   difference unless a level change spans it.  Grouping a zone's locations by level, the
;;;   groups must be joined; a location whose level has drifted leaves its own group
;;;   unjoined and is reachable by nothing.
;;;
;;; A LEVEL CHANGE, for the last two checks, is an authored STAIRWAY, JUMPING or CLIMBING
;;; traversal edge, or a floor drive's lift -- a floor-mounted fan or fixed floor blower
;;; launches its occupants from its own location to its AIMED-AT destination, which is how
;;; phobia-topo's agent reaches a loft ten units up with no traversal relation authored
;;; anywhere.  A WALKING edge is not one: the derivation that emits it is elevation-blind,
;;; and it is precisely the dead edge these checks detect.  Neither is REACH-VIA, which
;;; -traversal deliberately leaves outside the mode set: reaching across a step moves
;;; nobody over it.
;;;
;;; Same-zone locations at different levels are deliberate, not exceptional, so the zone
;;; check is a connectivity condition over level groups rather than an equality:
;;; claustro-topo's slab zone holds location11 at 0 and location13 at 3/2, joined by
;;; a STAIRWAY edge because the slab's west side carries no edge segment on purpose, and
;;; rumin-topo's zone 1 holds three ground locations and two at 3/2, joined by the
;;; STAIRWAY and JUMPING pair between location2 and location4.  An equality rule would
;;; reject both.
;;;
;;; Public WALKABILITY nests this file, so every walking problem receives the edge-span
;;; invariant automatically.  The two connectivity rules are deliberately not universal:
;;; a focused model may name locations at different levels specifically to characterize
;;; that coordinate-derived WALKING is elevation-blind, without claiming a complete route
;;; between them.  TEST-TOPO applies those stronger rules to the five full topology specs.
;;; The lower-level -WALKABILITY-COORDINATES substrate remains usable on its own with no
;;; vertical model and therefore retains its empty TERRAIN-COMPLAINTS seam.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : location; edge, declared optional by nested -segment-geometry
;;;   nested    : -walkability-coordinates (the arrangement, the TERRAIN-COMPLAINTS seam,
;;;               and -segment-geometry's EDGE-SEGMENT>); -vertical (BASE, TOP)
;;; PROVIDES:
