;;; Filename: -mobility-action.lisp

;;; Central movement action.  Transparent traversal providers compute grounded routes
;;; without mutating state, while configuration-transition providers expose one explicit
;;; support-changing boundary at a time.  MOVE presents both as routes between normalized
;;; (location ground-or-support) configurations and applies exactly one result.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested   : -propagation; -mobility; -configuration-transition
;;;   driver   : propagate-changes! (master), called by MOVE's effect and nested above
;;;              rather than assumed from a peer
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   query    : movement-results
;;;   action   : move
