;;; Filename: -recorder-init-checks.lisp

;;; Initialization validation for -recorder-core identity, exhaustive cargo copying,
;;; recording-layer isolation, and the explicitly supported shadow components.
;;;
;;; These checks read raw DEFINE-INIT literals, which by this point include whatever
;;; DERIVE-RECORDING-COPY-LITERALS derived from asterisk-named ghosts.  A failure therefore
;;; usually means a missing or misnamed type instance rather than a missing literal, and the
;;; messages below say so.
