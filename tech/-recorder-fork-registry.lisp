;;; Filename: -recorder-fork-registry.lisp

;;; Registry of optional START-RECORDER fork clauses.  The recorder must copy every live
;;; object's current state onto its ghost, but three of those relations -- PAIRED, JAMMING,
;;; and MOUNTED-ON -- belong to technologies a recorder problem may or may not include
;;; (beam-relay, jammer, -gears-fan).  Rather than have -recorder-session test for each
;;; owner's presence when it is spliced, each owner registers its own fork clause here and
;;; -recorder-session collects them when it installs START-RECORDER.
;;;
;;; This inverts the dependency, which is the point: (include-tech ...) splices textually in
;;; the order a problem lists its directives, so a presence test written in
;;; -recorder-session sees whatever happens to have been spliced before it.  Nothing in the
;;; splicer computes or validates that order, and a recorder listed before beam-relay used
;;; to install a PAIRED fork whose (doall (?terminus terminus)) ranged over an empty domain
;;; -- silently forking no pairings at all.  A clause registered by its own owner cannot be
;;; out of order with respect to that owner, and START-RECORDER's installation is deferred
;;; to INIT, by which point every technology has been spliced.
;;;
;;; This file deliberately nests nothing.  Both sides -- the recorder session and each
;;; relation owner -- include it, so whichever is spliced first brings it in and the
;;; splicer's deduplication gives the second one the same registry.
;;;
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   variable  : *recorder-fork-clauses*
;;;   function  : register-recorder-fork-clause
