;;; Filename: -apparatus-coordinates.lisp

;;; Apparatus-coordinates substrate: the fixed placement of a beam fixture, as its own
;;; capability independent of beams, sightlines, or the vertical model.  Owns
;;; APPARATUS-COORDS> so that -beam-los-coordinates' sightline derivation and -vertical's
;;; BASE share one source of truth for where each fixture is, without either depending on
;;; the other -- the same reason -location-coordinates exists for locations, and the
;;; reason this declaration no longer sits inside the 500-line -beam-los-coordinates.
;;;
;;; The third coordinate is the fixture's mounting level and may be omitted, defaulting to
;;; 1: apparatus hangs on a wall at about chest height unless a problem says otherwise.
;;; That default is why a FLOOR-REPEATER is excluded below -- it stands on the floor, so
;;; its base defaults to 0, and it keeps HAS-ELEVATION.  A problem with no coordinate
;;; geometry can still give any fixture a level through -elevation's HAS-ELEVATION; a
;;; fixture naming both is cross-checked here rather than silently preferring one.
;;;
;;; Self-contained; spliced by (include-tech -apparatus-coordinates).
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : transmitter, receiver, floor-repeater, wall-repeater, gun, switch -- all
;;;               optional; a problem declaring none of them gets an empty relation
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   relation  : (apparatus-coords>
;;;                 (either transmitter receiver floor-repeater wall-repeater gun switch)
;;;                 $rational $rational $rational)  --  z optional, defaulting to 1
