;;; Filename: tray.lisp

;;; Tray technology: a carryable, stackable support -- but only while held.  An agent can
;;; pick up a tray within the fixed vertical reach limit and put a held tray on the ground,
;;; a plate, a clear box top, or another agent's currently-held tray, exactly like a box.
;;; Unlike a box, a tray also supports occupants of its own while held: another agent may
;;; place an object on any currently-held tray (see -placement's held-tray clause), and
;;; that object's has-location tracks the holder's as it moves (see
;;; -configuration-transition's relocation cascade).  A tray resting on the ground is
;;; inert: a local release settles riders onto the highest unique eligible surface
;;; at or below their previous base, with ground fallback. Across-reach releases retain
;;; ground unloading. Nothing can be placed on an unheld tray.  A tray keeps its has-location fact
;;; even while held, the one deviation from held cargo having no location, so that its
;;; occupant's has-location consumers (beam-relay, visibility, etc.) keep working
;;; unchanged while the tray is held.
;;; Initialization therefore requires a held tray's retained HAS-LOCATION to match its
;;; holder, forbids the held tray from also resting ON something, and rejects any ON chain
;;; in which the tray would support its own holder; -physical-init-checks owns those shared
;;; physical-state checks.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location; tray is declared optional here
;;;   nested    : -propagation (propagate-changes!, the master driver this file's effects
;;;               call);
;;;               -placement (placement-options, place-held-object!, reach policy, and
;;;               vertical/support geometry);
;;;               -reachability (identity-default reachable, overridden by reachability);
;;;               -pickup (pickup-clear, shared with box, jammer, and beam-relay)
;;;   driver    : propagate-changes! (master), nested above rather than assumed from a peer
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : tray -- declared optional here
;;;   actions   : pickup-tray, put-tray

(define-action pickup-tray
  ;; Pick up a tray resting on the ground or on a support, within reach.  Unlike other
  ;; cargo, a tray keeps its has-location fact even while held (synced to its holder's
  ;; location by apply-agent-configuration!'s relocation cascade), so a tray already held
  ;; by someone else must be excluded explicitly instead of relying on a missing
  ;; has-location to rule it out.  A grounded tray is always clear by construction --
  ;; nothing can rest on a tray unless it is held -- so no cleartop check is needed here.
