;;; Filename: beam-crossing.lisp

;;; Beam crossing technology: crossing points that cut beams when both authored beam
;;; segments reach the crossing.  A peer over -beam-substrate, adding only crossing-
;;; specific behavior; it does NOT pull in the direct beam line, so a problem wanting
;;; a direct line must include beam-direct as well.  If beam-relay is also included,
;;; relay beams participate through relay hook queries supplied by beam-relay.
;;; BEAM-CROSSING> is derived internally, lazily and once, from whichever facts populate
;;; CROSSINGS-ALONG-BEAM> -- hand-authored directly, or computed from coordinates via the
;;; nested -beam-crossing-coordinates substrate (see that file; problem-corner-topo uses the
;;; coordinate path).  A problem may still assert
;;; BEAM-CROSSING> itself; it is simply never read.
;;;
;;; Self-contained; spliced by (include-tech beam-crossing).
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : crossing is declared optional by the nested -beam-crossing-coordinates
;;;               substrate and stays empty; the pool is minted at init time and reached
;;;               through CURRENT-BEAM-CROSSINGS/GET-CURRENT-BEAM-CROSSINGS rather than through the
;;;               type extension, so no problem declares it; los-endpoint is declared by the nested
;;;               -beam-los-coordinates substrate (via -beam-crossing-coordinates);
;;;               transmitter is declared optional here (define-optional-types); gate comes
;;;               from nested -gate
;;;   driver    : propagate-consequences! must call update-crossing-status! before
;;;               update-relay-status! and/or update-receiver-status!
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   nested    : -beam-crossing-coordinates (optional coordinate-based CROSSINGS-ALONG-BEAM>/
;;;               BEAM-CROSSINGS-BEFORE-GATE> input; itself nests -beam-los-coordinates for
;;;               LOS-ENDPOINT, APPARATUS-COORDS>, WALL-SEGMENT>, EDGE-SEGMENT>, GATE-SEGMENT>,
;;;               BOUNDARY-WALL, and LOS derivation);
;;;               -gate (gate optional type, (open gate) relation) -- shared with gate,
;;;               walkability (via -passability), reachability, visibility, and
;;;               beam-direct, which all nest -gate instead of hand-declaring it
;;;   types     : transmitter  --  declared optional here; other techs (gate,
;;;               walkability, visibility, reachability, beam-direct, -beam-substrate,
;;;               beam-relay, etc.) independently declare their own transmitter-alias
;;;               for their own pre-params; the bare and aliased forms resolve compatibly
;;;   relations : crossing-active, beam-crossing>, crossings-along-beam>,
;;;               beam-crossings-before-gate>, current-beam-crossings
