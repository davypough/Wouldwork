;;; Filename: -recorder-core.lisp

;;; Recorder identity and cross-layer interaction policy.  RECORDING-COPY> maps each live
;;; mobile object to the ghost that replays it.  The relation is directional and
;;; one-to-one, with static indexes in both directions; recorder initialization adds the disjoint,
;;; leaf-category-compatible, and exhaustive loose-cargo invariants.  The relation also
;;; registers its ordered tuples as coupled symmetry rows.
;;;
;;; A problem need not state the mapping.  DERIVE-RECORDING-COPY-LITERALS below reads it off
;;; the problem's own DEFINE-TYPES: a mobile object whose name ends in an asterisk is the
;;; recording copy of the object named without it.  The mapping carries no information the
;;; type declarations lack, because INIT-CHECK-RECORDING-CARGO-COMPLETENESS and
;;; INIT-CHECK-RECORDING-LOCATIONS already require every cargo instance and every located
;;; mobile object to sit on one side of a pair -- a problem has no freedom to map less than
;;; all of them.  An explicit RECORDING-COPY> literal remains legal and suppresses derivation
;;; for the objects it names, which is what lets a problem use unstarred ghost names.
;;;
;;; This file deliberately owns no apparatus shadow state and no propagation update.  It
;;; identifies the recording view, selects which mapped objects existed in that view, and
;;; keeps shared manipulation actions within the appropriate layer.  Capability-specific
;;; state lives in the -recorder-*-shadow components assembled by recorder.lisp.  The core
;;; does own their lifecycle registry: each stateful component registers how its own shadow
;;; is reset and, when necessary, seeded at a chained-cycle boundary.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -location (mobile-object); -holding (cargo and holding, needed to
;;;            recognize a ghost-held tray); -position (recorder has-position role);
;;;            -interaction-policy (neutral action hooks); -recording-shadow-policy
;;;            (neutral environmental-view hooks)
;;; RECORDING-IN-PROGRESS is declared here, rather than alongside the START-RECORDER /
;;; STOP-RECORDER / CANCEL-PLAYBACK actions that set it (-recorder-session.lisp), because
;;; OBJECT-MANIPULATION-ALLOWED and CONNECTOR-PAIRING-ALLOWED below need to read it, and
;;; this file is the first component -recorder.lisp assembles.  -recorder-session.lisp
;;; nests this file for the relation, not the other way around.
;;;
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   type     : recorder, connector, tray (optional)
;;;   relation : recording-copy> (indexed live mobile-object -> ghost mobile-object);
