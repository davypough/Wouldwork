;;; Filename: -physical-init-checks.lisp

;;; Initialization validation for shared physical placement facts and live-cargo presence.
;;;
;;; A support top holds at most one occupant per recorder layer, not at most one occupant:
;;; the live and ghost worlds are superimposed during playback, so a live object and a
;;; ghost object may rest on the same support.  With no recorder in the problem nothing is
;;; on either layer, and the check reduces to the familiar single-occupant rule.  The
;;; RECORDING-COPY> literals are already complete here -- DERIVE-RECORDING-COPY-LITERALS
;;; runs as an initialization literal generator, ahead of every init check -- so
;;; asterisk-named ghosts are classified alongside authored ones.
