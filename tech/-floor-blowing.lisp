;;; Filename: -floor-blowing.lisp

;;; Shared floor-blowing behavior for both forms of floor-directed blower:
;;;
;;;   * a removable fan mounted on floor-gears; and
;;;   * a fixed combined floor-blower.
;;;
;;; Floor-mounted fans and fixed floor blowers expose the same flush support surface.
;;; While blowing, they launch occupants to the drive's aimed-at destination and sustain
;;; them there.  When the stream stops, unsupported occupants at that destination fall
;;; back to the drive's location.  The public floor-gears.lisp and floor-blower.lisp
;;; technologies both include this file so a problem can name the kind of object it
;;; actually declares without duplicating the shared physics.
;;; Like every blower drive, each floor drive must have exactly one HAS-POSITION source and
;;; AIMED-AT destination; -gears-fan owns that shared completeness check beside AIMED-AT.
;;; Each floor drive must also have its own destination.  Hover state records the destination,
;;; not a launch-source relation, so sharing one destination would make the eventual drop-back
;;; source ambiguous; FLOOR-BLOWING-INIT-CHECK rejects that floor-only error.
;;; A floor stream rises vertically.  When both its positioned source and destination have
;;; LOCATION-COORDS>, the same check therefore requires their x/y coordinates to match.
;;; Whenever both endpoint levels are authored through coordinates or HAS-ELEVATION, the
;;; destination must also be strictly above the source.  Problems omitting either piece of
;;; geometry retain the abstract source/destination representation.
;;;
;;; A launched box carries its stack.  A jamming jammer or paired connector retains its
;;; relation through launch and fall; propagation re-derives the effect from its new
;;; location.  A fan resting on the source is too flat to catch the stream and is merely
;;; toppled onto the source location's ground.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location
;;;   nested    : -gears-fan (types, mounting, shared blower state and cargo actions);
;;;               -vertical (base, location-coords>, has-elevation, and the
;;;               location-level seam overridden here)
;;;   driver    : the derived propagation driver calls update-floor-blowing-status!
;;;               after update-blower-status!
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   query     : location-level -- overrides -vertical's seam so an undeclared
;;;               floor-stream destination defaults to the in-air hover elevation 10.
;;;               LOCATION-ELEVATION itself is NOT overridden: it is -vertical's memoizing
;;;               entry point, and overriding it would discard the memo.  This override
;;;               reads only static relations -- LOCATION-COORDS>, HAS-ELEVATION, AIMED-AT
;;;               -- which is what keeps that memo sound
;;;   updates   : update-floor-blowing-status!, blow-occupants-away!, drop-occupants!
;;;   init check: floor-blowing-init-check -- destinations have unique drive owners,
;;;               and geometry-known lifts rise vertically
