;;; Filename: jump.lisp

;;; Jumping mobility mode, plus the explicit support-changing transitions only jumping
;;; provides.  Registers the one predicate that makes a traversal edge a jump: the landing
;;; may rise no more than *vertical-reach-limit* above the launch, and every feature in the
;;; chosen clause that is not currently passable must be low enough to clear within that
;;; same bound.  Level and downward landings are unrestricted.
;;;
;;; Jumping handles exclusively elevation-related moves: local support changes involve box
;;; tops only (mounting and dismounting flush supports like plates and gears-mounted fans
;;; belongs to the step technology; a fan resting on a box top is not a jump landing).
;;; Open gates and passable screens impose no clearance requirement.  Closed gates,
;;; non-passable screens, and walls contribute their top elevations; a multi-feature jump
;;; must clear the highest feature that is not currently passable.
;;;
;;; Each produced segment or transition is tagged JUMP when nothing required clearance, or
;;; VAULT when some feature genuinely did (accounting for passability) -- a move-type label
;;; a printed route displays alongside WALK, STAIRS, and LADDER.  It is a label on the
;;; segment, not a mode: both come from the one authored JUMPING edge, and which one a
;;; crossing earns depends on the state it is evaluated in.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location  --  box and wall are declared optional here
;;;   nested    : -vertical (top, location-elevation);
;;;               -support-elevation (support occupancy and *vertical-reach-limit*, which
;;;               this file reuses rather than defining its own jump-specific parameter);
;;;               -passability (holding and
;;;               obstacle-clear); -threat (safe); -traversal; -mobility-action
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : box, wall  --  declared optional; jumping remains usable without them
