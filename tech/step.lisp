;;; Filename: step.lisp

;;; Step technology: provide ground-level mounting and dismounting transitions for flush
;;; supports (plates and
;;; gears-mounted fans).  A steppable's top sits exactly at its location's floor elevation,
;;; so stepping involves no elevation change -- that is what distinguishes step transitions
;;; from the jump technology, which handles exclusively elevation-related support changes
;;; (box tops) and authored jump edges.  A fan is steppable only while mounted on gears: a
;;; fan lying on the ground or resting on a box top cannot be stepped on (nor jumped to).
;;; Stepping on a plate depresses it (plate's update-plate-status! derives depression from
;;; support-occupied), so an agent can hold a gate or gears control active with its own
;;; weight;
;;; stepping on a fan whose gears are turning launches the agent to the gears' aimed-at
;;; destination during the ensuing propagation.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location; plate comes from nested -plate-types; fan,
;;;               floor-blower, and angled-blower are declared optional here
;;;   nested    : -mobility-action (central MOVE action, configuration representation,
;;;               transition registry, support mutation, and propagation);
;;;               -position ((has-position ...))
;;;   conditional relations:
;;;               mounted-on (fan), guarded by fan  --  owned by -gears-fan.lisp;
;;;               translation removes the guarded reference when the fan type is empty
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : steppable-object (either pressure-plate toggle-plate fan floor-blower
;;;               angled-blower)
;;;   queries   : step-source-can-mount, step-source-can-dismount,
;;;               steppable-fixture-at, step-configuration-transitions
;;;   provider  : step-configuration-transitions registered with
;;;               -configuration-transition
;;;   action    : move (from -mobility-action)
