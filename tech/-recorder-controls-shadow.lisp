;;; Filename: -recorder-controls-shadow.lisp

;;; Recording-side controller evaluation shared by gates and wall gears.  It mirrors
;;; -controls' DNF polarity but reads recording switch, plate, and receiver state.  The aggregate
;;; remains textually separate from CONTROL-ON so the propagation walker sees disjoint
;;; playback and recording read sets.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -controls (CONTROLS and ordinary control schema); -recorder-switch-shadow;
;;;            -recorder-plate-shadow; -recorder-receiver-shadow
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   queries : recording-controller-energized, recording-control-on
