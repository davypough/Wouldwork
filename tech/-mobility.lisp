;;; Filename: -mobility.lisp

;;; Mobility substrate: composes pure traversal providers into a canonical transparent
;;; movement closure.  Providers return normalized segments of the form
;;; (mode source witness destination).  MOBILITY-RESULTS returns
;;; (destination route) pairs, including (source nil) for reflexivity.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types    : agent, location
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   queries  : mobility-results, mobility-locations, traversable
;;;   functions: register-mobility-provider and canonical closure helpers
