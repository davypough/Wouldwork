;;; Filename: -walkability-coordinates.lisp

;;; Walkability coordinates substrate: derives the WALKING traversal edges (and, for
;;; rides into an air stream's destination, their directed form) from raw segment
;;; geometry, for a problem that
;;; would rather author 2D positions than hand-list which locations can walk to which.
;;; Nested under public walkability and under -stream-passability; entirely inert unless
;;; the problem actually asserts WALL-SEGMENT>, EDGE-SEGMENT>, or BOUNDARY-WALL -- a
;;; problem that hand-authors its walking edges directly is unaffected.  Edge segments block
;;; walking exactly like wall segments -- both feed the same solids list below.  LOS gives
;;; edges finite height, but walking remains elevation-blind and jumping excludes edges.
;;;
;;; Walking connectivity is a region-adjacency question.  Every wall/gate/window/screen
;;; segment and boundary edge is axis-aligned (a diagonal one is an authoring mistake,
;;; caught during initialization validation; the derivation also checks its own
;;; invariant).  The segments' own coordinates induce a coordinate-compressed
;;; arrangement: a grid of cells whose edge-intervals are each classified from the
;;; segments covering them -- solid (wall/window/boundary), one conjunctive hard-door
;;; clause (one or more co-located gates/screens), one stream curtain, or open.  A stream
;;; curtain cannot share an interval with another door because its directional ride
;;; semantics are not an ordinary conjunction.  A gate/screen whose vertical span
;;; intersects a coincident solid is likewise an authoring contradiction and error.  Cells
;;; united across open intervals form zones; door intervals between distinct zones form
;;; a labeled zone graph.  A door may share an XY interval with a wall or edge only when
;;; the solid's top is at or below the door's base: that is a supported elevated doorway,
;;; not a doorway cut through the solid.  Its planar interval remains solid for this
;;; single-layer walking arrangement; an authored jump, climb, or stairway handles access
;;; at the upper level.  Every genuine vertical overlap remains an authoring error.
;;; For every zone pair, a fixpoint over antichains of door-sets
;;; computes ALL subset-minimal door-sets -- each a set of doors sufficient for some
;;; physical route -- and a location pair's traverse-via value is that family in DNF: ()
;;; still means direct/unguarded, and a nonempty value is a list of clauses, OR over
;;; clauses, AND within (matching the CONTROLS convention).  Families are emitted in
;;; canonical order (doors within a clause by name; clauses by length then
;;; lexicographically) so derived facts are deterministic and diffable.
;;;
;;; A wall-mounted fan's air stream is DERIVED geometry, not authored: its center line
;;; runs from the gears' HAS-POSITION location (the swept location) to the AIMED-AT
;;; destination (error unless axis-aligned), extended backward behind the fan to the
;;; nearest solid (the backstop -- the wall the gears hang on), and widened to the
;;; stream's width -- 3 units by default, overridable per gears with a STREAM-WIDTH
;;; fact (see -stream-passability.lisp, which owns that relation and redefines
;;; WALKABILITY-COORDINATES-STREAM-SPECS to gather the facts; the default here
;;; returns none, so walkability alone never references blower relations).  The
;;; resulting band is a conditional barrier region: its perimeter -- the front edge at
;;; the destination and the two sides, never the backstop edge -- enters the
;;; arrangement as curtain intervals labeled with the GEARS name (passable only while
;;; no blowing fan is mounted -- see -stream-passability's OBSTACLE-CLEAR extension),
;;; clipped silently wherever a solid already covers them.  Crossing the band anywhere
;;; costs its gears once: two curtains on one route dedupe in the door-set algebra.
;;;
;;; A location on a stream curtain -- the AIMED-AT destination's normal situation,
;;; mid-interval on the front curtain -- belongs to the zone OUTSIDE the band only, and
;;; the swept location in the band's interior belongs to the band's own zone only, so
;;; every walking edge to or from either spot's band side carries the gears in each
;;; clause automatically: the flowing stream is a wall, and its interior is standable
;;; exactly while it is off.  Riding the stream is instead a property of the
;;; destination: from every zone flanking the band across a SIDE curtain, the
;;; destination's inbound direction additionally unions that zone's own family --
;;; while blowing, stepping laterally into the flow carries the walker to the
;;; destination; while off, the same trip is an ordinary walk across the dead band; so
;;; the unconditional edge is correct in both regimes, and such pairs are emitted as
;;; directional traverse-via> facts (rides widen inbound, never outbound).  The front
;;; curtain grants no ride -- walking in against the flow is barred like any other
;;; gears-gated crossing.  Any other location inside a
;;; band, on a covered solid interval, inside a gate/screen doorway, at a corner whose
;;; surrounding cells span several zones, or outside a declared boundary, errors.
;;; Location coordinates never induce grid lines -- they are points looked up in the
;;; arrangement afterward, so fractional authoring offsets need no grid alignment.
;;;
;;; The derivation is single-layer: after recognizing the supported-door exception above,
;;; segment coverage is elevation-blind and blocks every walking pair that crosses it
;;; regardless of level.  Multi-level maps therefore author an
;;; elevated platform's ground-level footprint as wall or edge segments (edge is the
;;; better fit -- it is precisely the vertical surface between two different-elevation
;;; regions), keep the platform's own locations inside that footprint, and connect the
;;; levels only with authored STAIRWAY, JUMPING, or CLIMBING edges (which this
;;; derivation never touches); ONE-STEP-WALKABLE's
;;; elevation-equality check rejects any derived edge between different levels, including
;;; two distinct locations sharing the same x/y point.  See problem-claustro-topo's slab
;;; (edge1/edge2) and problem-phobia-topo's location10/location11 pair for the patterns.
;;;
;;; Reuses LOCATION-COORDS> (nested from -location-coordinates, shared with
;;; visibility's -beam-los-coordinates substrate) for location coordinates.  Reuses the
;;; individually authored segment relations from nested -segment-geometry, shared with
;;; -beam-los-coordinates without requiring any beam tech.  SCREEN-SEGMENT> has no beam
;;; consumer, and streams none at
