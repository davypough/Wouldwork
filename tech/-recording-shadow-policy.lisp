;;; Filename: -recording-shadow-policy.lisp

;;; Neutral hooks for selecting an object's environmental state view.  Ordinary problems
;;; use only shared playback state.  -recorder-core selects the recording objects and their
;;; presence, while the gate and blower-drive shadow components override their capability
;;; hooks.  Beam peers consume those selections for recording-side beam state.
;;;
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   queries : recording-shadow-object          -- object uses recording-side physics
;;;             recording-shadow-object-present  -- object exists in recording view
;;;             recording-shadow-turning         -- a blower drive turns in recording-side state
;;;             recording-shadow-gate-open        -- gate is open in recording-side state
