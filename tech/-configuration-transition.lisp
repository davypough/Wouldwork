;;; Filename: -configuration-transition.lisp

;;; Explicit agent-configuration transitions.  Providers describe one state-changing
;;; transition at a time as
;;;
;;;   (mode source-configuration witness destination-configuration)
;;;
;;; where each configuration is (location ground-or-support).  Unlike mobility, these
;;; transitions are never transitively closed: changing support is a planning boundary
;;; because it can clear or occupy supports and trigger propagation.  This is also the
;;; entry point for voluntary agent movement. Shared -support-motion also relocates
;;; supported agents and their held trays during physical transport; both use the
;;; same dependency traversal.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location
;;;   nested    : -support-occupancy; -location; -propagation; -holding (cargo, holding;
;;;               tray declared optional here so agent movement never requires a problem
;;;               to declare tray objects)
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   query     : agent-configuration, configuration-transition-results
;;;   functions : register-configuration-transition-provider and canonical selection helpers
;;;   update    : apply-agent-configuration!  --  also relocates a held tray and its
;;;               riders, keeping the tray's has-location synced to its holder's
;;;               relocate-tray-and-riders! -- typed entry to -support-motion's shared
;;;               relocation, including nested held trays and their riders.
