;;; Filename: -traversal.lisp

;;; Traversal substrate: one topology relation for every way an agent crosses between two
;;; locations, replacing the five near-identical relation pairs -- WALK-VIA/WALK-VIA>,
;;; STAIRS-VIA/STAIRS-VIA>, JUMP-VIA/JUMP-VIA>, CLIMB-VIA> -- and the four near-identical
;;; provider queries that read them.  What genuinely differed between those technologies
;;; was never the relation or the iteration; it was one predicate each, and that is all
;;; each of them registers here now.
;;;
;;;   (traverse-via  <mode> <source> <dnf> <destination>)   symmetric
;;;   (traverse-via> <mode> <source> <dnf> <destination>)   directed, source first
;;;
;;; Directionality stays in the name, as everywhere else in this domain: the engine
;;; mirrors a relation whose argument types repeat and whose name does not end in ">", and
;;; the repeated type here is LOCATION, so prepending the mode leaves the two location
;;; positions as the mirrored pair.  The mode cannot be bound out of a fact -- a fluentless
;;; storage key needs every non-fluent argument ground -- so TRAVERSAL-SEGMENTS iterates
;;; the mode type rather than reading it off the edge.
;;;
;;; The payload is DNF everywhere, which is the change that closes the comprehension
;;; hazard behind the old shape: WALK-VIA read its list as OR-over-clauses while
;;; STAIRS-VIA, JUMP-VIA and CLIMB-VIA> read theirs as a flat conjunction, and both
;;; readings accept (), the common case, so the divergence almost never bit.  Now () is
;;; direct and unguarded, and anything else is a list of clauses: OR over clauses, AND
;;; within one -- the same convention CONTROLS uses.  A mode picks the first clause its
;;; own predicate accepts, in canonical order, so an edge can offer alternative routes
;;; whatever the mode.
;;;
;;; REACH-VIA is deliberately not a mode here.  Reaching across a barrier authorizes
;;; manipulation, not movement: REACHABLE is no mobility provider, applies no elevation or
;;; distance test, and its payload means "these gates must be open" rather than "these
;;; obstacles must be passable for the mover".  Folding it in would put a relation that
;;; moves nobody into the relation that moves everybody.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location
;;;   nested    : -mobility (the provider registry) alone.  This file calls no obstacle,
;;;               threat or elevation rule of its own -- every one of those lives in a
;;;               mode's builder, and that mode's technology nests what it needs.  The
;;;               clause types the init check validates against likewise come from
;;;               whichever technology registered the mode
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : traversal-mode (walking stairway jumping climbing)
;;;   relations : (traverse-via traversal-mode location $list location),
;;;               (traverse-via> traversal-mode location $list location)
;;;   queries   : traversal-segments  --  the single mobility provider, cached;
;;;               traversal-segments-for-source  --  the computation behind it
;;;   init      : traversal-init-check
;;;   functions : register-traversal-mode, register-traversal-cache-parameter, and the
;;;               canonical DNF family algebra the coordinate zone-graph derivation in
;;;               -walkability-coordinates uses

;;;; SEGMENT CACHE ;;;;
;;;; TRAVERSAL-SEGMENTS is a pure function of the agent, the source location, the value of
;;;; every parameter a registered builder reads, and the state's projection onto a short
;;;; list of dynamic relations.  So it is cached by CONTENT: two states projecting alike
;;;; share an entry, and nothing ever needs invalidating.  Measured on RUMIN-TOPO at
;;;; depth 8, 831,175 calls collapse to 10 entries.
;;;;
;;;; *TRAVERSAL-STATE-DEPENDENCIES* is narrower than the transitive read set, deliberately,
;;;; and that is the one thing here that could go silently wrong.  A raw-body scan of the
;;;; builders' call graph also reports HAS-LOCATION and ON, which are reached only through
;;;; BASE -- of a location in LOCATION-LEVEL, and of a gate, screen or wall in
;;;; JUMP-BARRIER-TOP-ELEVATION.  None of those object kinds is ever ON anything, held, or
;;;; given a HAS-LOCATION, so every one of those binds fails and the read is vacuous.  That
;;;; is an argument about which types reach BASE, not something any static analysis can see,
;;;; and including the two relations anyway would key the cache on facts that change every
;;;; move and destroy the hit rate.  *TRAVERSAL-CACHE-PARANOID* exists to hold the argument
;;;; to account: see the file's companion note in claude/traversal-caching-plan.md.
;;;;
;;;; Adding a mode, an obstacle kind, or an override that reads a dynamic relation means
;;;; adding that relation here.  Run a full suite under the paranoid special afterwards.
