;;; Filename: -controls.lisp

;;; Controls substrate: the shared DNF controller wiring for controlled devices (gates and
;;; gears) and the energized query that evaluates a single controller.  Owned in one
;;; place so gate.lisp and -gears-fan.lisp nest this file instead of each declaring
;;; controls/energized; both previously lived in gate.lisp.  CONTROL-ON evaluates the DNF
;;; aggregate once for every consumer -- gate, gears, and gun -- taking the uncontrolled
;;; default as an argument, since that is the only thing that varied between the copies it
;;; replaced (an uncontrolled gate reduces to open <=> jammed; uncontrolled gears and guns
;;; run until something disables them).
;;;
;;; Recorder's recording-side aggregate is deliberately a separate query in
;;; -recorder-controls-shadow.lisp rather than a view argument here.
;;; WW-PROPAGATION-ORDER's walker recurses into query
;;; bodies to compute each update's read set, and prunes only tests STATIC-FORM-TRUTH can
;;; decide; a view passed as a query parameter is not one, so a single body branching on it
;;; would credit UPDATE-GATE-STATUS! with reading RECORDING-LATCHED and
;;; UPDATE-RECORDING-GATE-STATUS! with reading LATCHED.  Those invented edges cross the
;;; playback and recording strata in both directions and can close a cycle in the derived
;;; driver.  Two textually separate aggregates keep the two read sets disjoint, which is
;;; the property the derivation actually needs.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested    : -beam-substrate ((active receiver)) -- pulls in the full receiver machinery
;;;               even in a receiver-free problem (e.g. blower-only or gun-only, reached
;;;               through -gears-fan); harmless and expected, since update-receiver-status!
;;;               quantifies over an empty receiver type there and report-inert-techs names it
;;;   conditional relations, owned by plate.lisp and -switch.lisp:
;;;               depressed (pressure-plate), guarded by pressure-plate
;;;               latched (toggle-plate), guarded by toggle-plate
;;;               switched-on (switch), guarded by switch
;;;               Translation removes either guarded reference when its leaf type is empty.
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : mode (normal inverted), owned here; plate comes from -plate-types;
;;;               gate, the three gears leaves, the three fixed blower leaves, receiver,
;;;               and gun are
;;;               declared optional here.  The gears leaf types appear directly (not via
;;;               the gears union) because this file splices before -gears-fan installs
;;;               the union; gun likewise appears directly since gun.lisp nests this file
;;;               rather than the other way around.
;;;   relations : (controls $list (either gate floor-gears wall-gears angled-gears
;;;               floor-blower wall-blower angled-blower gun)
;;;               $mode)  --  $list = DNF OR-list of AND-lists of controllers
;;;               (receiver/plate/switch); mode: normal | inverted
;;;   queries   : energized, control-on
;;;
;;; DEFINE-INIT VALIDATION:
;;;   - the DNF value and every clause must be lists
;;;   - every clause member must be a receiver, plate, or switch
;;;   - a controlled device may have only one CONTROLS fact
;;;   - only NORMAL and INVERTED modes are supported
;;;   - () and (()) are both valid and intentionally distinct
