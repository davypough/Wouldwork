;;; Recording-side jamming view shared by gates and wall gears.  JAMMING remains the one
;;; action-owned relation; this component filters it to mapped ghost jammers rather than
;;; duplicating either the relation or its lifecycle.

;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested      : -recorder-core (ghost identity)
;;;   conditional : JAMMING from jammer.lisp, guarded by optional JAMMER
;;; PROVIDES:
