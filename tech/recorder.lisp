;;; Public recorder assembly.  Problems continue to write only (include-tech recorder).
;;; Identity and interaction isolation live in -recorder-core; each supported apparatus
;;; owns a private recording-shadow component.  Including this public assembly also installs
;;; recorder-specific prefix pruning, interleaving audit/pruning, candidate validation,
;;; solution reporting, and goal chaining after all implementations have been defined.
;;;
;;; Recorder start/stop/cancel transitions and their cycle count are planner-native and
;;; repeatable.
;;; The path parser accepts repeated setup/start/window/ending cycles and an optional
;;; final open window.  Every generated STOP or CANCEL successor validates its just-completed
;;; cycle and rejects a closed cycle without persistent progress before goal or duplicate
;;; processing.  At equal normalized boundaries, an equal-or-cheaper path with fewer cycles
;;; used dominates one with more cycles.  Final candidate validation checks all cycles plus
;;; the complete integrated path.  One ordinary SOLVE therefore optimizes across every
;;; permitted cycle.  The report reconstructs every cycle and its local metrics from the
;;; accepted path while retaining complete-solution totals.
;;;
;;; Recorder cycle chaining remains an explicitly guided convenience.  Each SOLVE-SUBGOAL
;;; is capped at and required to consume exactly one additional cycle, and the following
;;; SOLVE does the same for the final cycle.  The configured maximum limits the complete
;;; guided history.  Its retained history is locally optimized per search and makes no
;;; global claim.
;;;
;;; The component order preserves the established propagation seed:
;;; ordinary receiver state, recording switch and plate state, recording receiver state,
;;; recording gate state, then recording blower-drive state.  The derived propagation driver still
;;; orders the final calls from their actual read/write graph.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES / PROVIDES VIA COMPONENTS:
;;;   -recorder-core               : RECORDING-COPY>, RECORDING-IN-PROGRESS, side identity,
;;;                                  object presence, and cross-layer interaction policy
;;;   -recorder-plate-shadow       : RECORDING-DEPRESSED / RECORDING-LATCHED
;;;   -recorder-switch-shadow      : RECORDING-SWITCHED-ON
;;;   -recorder-receiver-shadow    : RECORDING-ACTIVE
;;;   -recorder-controls-shadow    : recording-side DNF controller evaluation
;;;   -recorder-jamming-shadow     : ghost-filtered RECORDING-JAMMED
;;;   -recorder-gate-shadow        : RECORDING-OPEN and gate-view hook
;;;   -recorder-blower-shadow      : RECORDING-TURNING and blower-view hook
;;;   -recorder-solution           : multi-window parsing, mandatory ending validation,
;;;                                  optional open-prefix validation, interleaving
;;;                                  audit/pruning, candidate validation, and report
;;;   -recorder-session            : START-RECORDER / STOP-RECORDER / CANCEL-PLAYBACK
;;;                                  actions and the
;;;                                  live-to-ghost state fork; nests -recorder-solution,
;;;                                  so its own list position is a readability choice, not
;;;                                  a load-order requirement
;;;   -recorder-cycle-boundary     : closed-cycle goal and fresh-shadow preparation
;;;   -recorder-cycle-chaining     : sequential checkpoints, cumulative replay, final report
;;;   -recorder-init-checks        : mapping, isolation, and supported-scope validation
;;;
;;; The supported behavior includes switches, plates, direct/relay-fed receivers, gates,
;;; wall drives, fixed floor blowers, and their jamming have recording views.  Initialization rejects
;;; beam crossings, floor gears, angled blowers, threats, receiver-controlled blower drives,
;;; movable wall-fan copies, and any other explicitly unsupported combination rather than
;;; approximating it at runtime.

;; *RECORDER-PREFIX-PRUNING* is a managed problem parameter defined in ww-settings.lisp,
;; so a problem sets it with (ww-set *recorder-prefix-pruning* t) like any other setting,
;; it appears in the current parameter display, and staging resets it to NIL.
