;;; Filename: -recorder-cycle-boundary.lisp

;;; Recorder-specific continuation policy.  A chained cycle has a stronger termination
;;; contract than a standalone recorder solve: its searched path itself reaches a normalized
;;; ending, through either normal ghost STOP or live cancellation.  Report-only return
;;; markers therefore never become a committed boundary by accident.
;;;
;;; STOP-RECORDER and CANCEL-PLAYBACK perform the same normalization directly in their
;;; successors: each removes every dynamic ghost reference, resets every capability-owned
;;; recording shadow, seeds stateful memory from the committed live playback baseline, and
;;; propagates consequences.
;;; PREPARE-RECORDER-CYCLE-STATE remains the copy-preserving entry point used by guided
;;; chaining, but delegates to that shared normalization.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -recorder-core (lifecycle registry); -recorder-solution
;;;            (RECORDER-CYCLE-ENDED); -propagation
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   queries   : recorder-cycle-boundary-safe, recorder-closed-ghost-free
;;;   functions : recorder-cycle-goal, close-recorder-cycle-state!,
;;;               normalize-recorder-cycle-shadow!, prepare-recorder-cycle-state
