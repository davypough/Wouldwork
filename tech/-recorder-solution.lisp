;;; Filename: -recorder-solution.lisp

;;; Recorder path services: multi-window parsing, mandatory completed-cycle validation and
;;; no-progress rejection, closed-boundary cycle-resource dominance, optional open
;;; recording-prefix pruning, automatic exact live/ghost interleaving canonicalization,
;;; candidate validation, and integrated multi-cycle reporting.  Nested
;;; by recorder.lisp, whose public assembly installs pruning, validation, reporting,
;;; and goal chaining after all recorder components have been defined.  Lower-level tests may
;;; include this file for its mechanics without installing those public services.  Nothing
;;; here is a substrate hook, and nothing here reads recording-side state.  The recorder
;;; shadow components derive
;;; RECORDING-DEPRESSED, RECORDING-LATCHED, RECORDING-TURNING, RECORDING-ACTIVE and
;;; RECORDING-OPEN during propagation, while these services run only during prefix or
;;; candidate replay and touch none of them.  What they do read is identity from -recorder-core --
;;; LIVE-RECORDING-OBJECT and GHOST-RECORDING-OBJECT -- plus location, position, the
;;; mobility closure, and (since GHOST-STOPS-RECORDER was strengthened to require a
;;; genuinely closed session) RECORDING-IN-PROGRESS, which is session lifecycle state, not
;;; one of the per-apparatus shadow views above.
;;;
;;; Every intermediate recording is physically ended by STOP-RECORDER or CANCEL-PLAYBACK.
;;; The parser also
;;; admits a final open cycle when the problem goal is reached first; its isolated recording
;;; must be executable, but physical closure is not added to that goal.  A problem that wants
;;; the final return and stop spelled out adds GHOST-STOPS-RECORDER as a goal conjunct.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -location ((has-location ...)); -position (recorder has-position role);
;;;            -mobility (mobility-results -- the identity default reduces
;;;            RECORDING-AGENT-CAN-CLOSE to standing on the recorder, which is the right
;;;            reading for a problem with no walking technology); -holding (cargo, holding
;;;            -- nested here rather than left to cargo-carrying techs, so a recording
;;;            session's closure rule is well-defined even in a cargo-free recorder
;;;            problem; empty CARGO there makes RECORDING-AGENT-EMPTY-HANDED a no-op)
