;;; Filename: box.lisp

;;; Box technology: a carryable, stackable support.  An agent can pick up a box within the
;;; fixed vertical reach limit and put a held box on reachable ground, a plate, or a clear
;;; box top.  A box
;;; is movable cargo that occupies its support via the (on ...) relation; it has no derived
;;; state of its own.  Agent jumping and support changes belong to the separate jump technology.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   types     : agent, location; plate comes from nested -plate-types and box is
;;;               declared optional here
;;;   nested    : -propagation (propagate-changes!, the master driver this file's effects
;;;               call);
;;;               -placement (placement-options, place-held-object!, reach policy, and
;;;               vertical/support geometry);
;;;               -reachability (identity-default reachable, overridden by reachability);
;;;               -pickup (pickup-clear, shared with jammer and beam-relay)
;;;   driver    : propagate-changes! (master), nested above rather than assumed from a peer
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : box -- declared optional here
;;;   actions   : pickup-box, put-box
