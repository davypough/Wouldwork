;;; Filename: topo-lower-bound.lisp

;;; Optional, domain-general lower-bound service for topology planning.  Its inexpensive
;;; finite-domain resource bound is the only term registered for automatic search pruning.
;;; Delete-relaxed h-max, LM-cut, beam, and combined queries remain explicit diagnostics.
;;; The staged problem supplies only its ordinary types, traversal facts, state, and active
;;; goal; no problem object names or coordinate regions are authored here.
;;;
;;; The relaxation is deliberately permissive:
;;;   - traversal keeps only gate prerequisites and ignores every other obstacle;
;;;   - placement keeps direct reach and support location, but ignores clearance and height;
;;;   - one beam-affecting action may activate every receiver;
;;;   - without blower propagation, normally controlled gates retain their positive DNF
;;;     plate/receiver/switch dependencies, one action may newly depress only one plate,
;;;     and each switch may be turned on by one relaxed toggle;
;;;   - inverted gates, jammer bypasses, and blower cascades keep one-action fallbacks;
;;;   - acquiring cargo costs one action without modeling the trip to it;
;;;   - tray placement propagates location only through the retained ON support chain;
;;;   - a domain with blower drives gets one-action relocation fallbacks;
;;;   - delete effects are absent, as the relaxed heuristics require.
;;; A companion finite-domain bound keeps one current location per agent while routing the
;;; supported cargo-location goals.  Its movement, manipulation, and recorder-session costs
;;; are disjoint; tray riders, propagating relocators, unsupported goals, and happenings are
;;; omitted rather than overestimated.
;;; Search registers that inexpensive finite-domain term as its automatic contributor.  A
;;; problem may separately define MIN-STEPS-REMAINING? as an aggregate fallback; serial
;;; depth-first search then samples an unproductive fallback after its technical warmup and
;;; immediately resumes eager evaluation if one uniquely prunes.  Parallel search remains
;;; eager.
;;; The generated static model is built once, then backward-sliced from the active goal.
;;; Per-state evaluation reads only facts used by that goal-relevant operator slice.
;;; Each omission can only shorten the abstract plan.  Unsupported goal forms are omitted
;;; from the partial model and therefore contribute zero rather than risking over-pruning.
;;; The model is not certified complete for unreachability: problem-defined actions may add
;;; transitions which are deliberately outside this technology-generated abstraction.
;;;
