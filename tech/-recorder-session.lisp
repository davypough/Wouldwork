;;; Filename: -recorder-session.lisp

;;; Recording session lifecycle.  START-RECORDER, STOP-RECORDER, and CANCEL-PLAYBACK are real planner
;;; actions, not report-only markers: the search itself chooses when a recording session
;;; opens and closes, giving ghost-state forking a well-defined, path-local moment instead
;;; of an inferred one.  START-RECORDER counts the cycle in planner state, clears the
;;; preceding closed marker, and performs the fork required by rules 5 and 11 of
;;; tech/Recorder-ghost operations in the Talos Principle.txt -- every mapped ghost object
;;; inherits its live counterpart's CURRENT has-location, holding, on, paired, jamming, and
;;; mounted-on state at the exact moment recording starts, not whatever -- if anything --
;;; define-init separately declared for it.  The agent operating the recorder must itself
;;; be empty-handed; holdings elsewhere in the mapped state still belong to the complete
;;; snapshot.  RECORDING-IN-PROGRESS also gates ghost
;;; existence itself (see -recorder-core.lisp's OBJECT-MANIPULATION-ALLOWED and
;;; CONNECTOR-PAIRING-ALLOWED): a ghost cannot act, and a live connector cannot reference a
;;; ghost terminus, before this action has run.  That gate is not just faithfulness to rule
;;; 5 -- it guarantees the live-side state START-RECORDER reads can never already contain a
;;; cross-layer reference, so the fork has no such edge case to handle.
;;;
;;; RECORDING-IN-PROGRESS is deliberately not named RECORDING-ACTIVE: that name is already
;;; taken by -recorder-receiver-shadow.lisp's per-receiver relation, which means something
;;; unrelated (recording-side beam power reaching one receiver).
;;;
;;; CONNECTOR, JAMMER, and FAN are redeclared optional here (idempotent and order-
;;; independent, per tech/README.html).  PAIRED, JAMMING, and MOUNTED-ON are not: each is
;;; owned by a technology a recorder problem may or may not include (beam-relay.lisp,
;;; jammer.lisp, -gears-fan.lisp), and a problem may type CONNECTOR or FAN instances
;;; without including that behavioral tech at all -- test/problem-recorder-test.lisp does
;;; exactly this, to exercise RECORDING-COPY>'s own mapping machinery in isolation.  Each
;;; owner therefore contributes its own fork clause through -recorder-fork-registry, and
;;; this file collects whatever was registered.  HAS-LOCATION, HOLDING, and ON need no such
;;; treatment -- they are already unconditionally available in any recorder problem via
;;; -recorder-core, -recorder-solution, and -recorder-controls-shadow's existing nesting.
;;;
;;; START-RECORDER is installed by INIT rather than at this file's splice position, through
;;; REGISTER-DEFERRED-ACTION-INSTALLER.  (include-tech ...) splices textually in whatever
;;; order a problem lists its directives, so anything this file inspects at splice time sees
;;; only the technologies that happen to precede it.  Deferring installation lets the action
;;; see every registered clause, and every type and relation, no matter where a problem
;;; lists (include-tech recorder).  STOP-RECORDER depends on none of that and stays an
;;; ordinary DEFINE-ACTION below.  INSTALL-ACTION is called directly rather than through
;;; DEFINE-ACTION only because the effect is assembled from registered clauses; the macro
;;; just quotes its argument text and calls the same function, so nothing is lost.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -recorder-cycle-boundary (cycle count, physical closure, ghost removal,
;;;            and shadow normalization); -location (HAS-LOCATION); -holding (HOLDING);
;;;            -support-occupancy (ON); -recorder-fork-registry (optional fork clauses)
;;; CANCEL-PLAYBACK is the live-side early ending.  The empty-handed live agent must reach
;;; a recorder, but the ghost need not have completed its recording or resolved its cargo:
;;; cancellation discards the unplayed remainder and every ghost dependency immediately.
;;;
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   actions   : start-recorder, stop-recorder, cancel-playback
