;;; Filename: -support-elevation.lisp

;;; Support-elevation policy: how far an agent can reach vertically.  This file no longer
;;; computes any geometry -- -vertical owns all of it.
;;;
;;; SUPPORT-TOP-ELEVATION and its held-tray special case TRAY-TOP-ELEVATION were exactly
;;; -vertical's TOP over the SUPPORT domain: a box's top is its base plus its height; a
;;; fan, tray, plate, or fixed blower is zero-thickness, so its top is its base; and a
;;; held tray's base is already its holder's top, which is what the special case computed
;;; by hand.  OCCUPANT-ELEVATION was BASE restricted to SUPPORT-OCCUPANT, minus the
;;; HOLDING branch: it resolved ON, then fell through to the occupant's own location.
;;; That branch is unreachable for every occupant it was called on, since held cargo
;;; loses its HAS-LOCATION -- and the one exception, a tray, is excluded from pickup while
;;; held and is zero-thickness anyway.  Callers use BASE and TOP directly.
;;;
;;; What remains is policy rather than geometry, and stays: the reach limit is a rule
;;; about what an agent may do, not a fact about where anything is.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested  : -vertical (base)
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   parameter : *vertical-reach-limit*, default 1 -- the maximum elevation gap an agent
;;;               can act across vertically: lifting cargo above or below its own elevation,
;;;               raising cargo onto a higher resting place, or jumping up onto a higher
;;;               support or clearing a barrier (jump.lisp reuses this parameter rather than
;;;               defining its own).  Independent of the agent's own declared height.  A
;;;               problem may override it with DEFPARAMETER after including its parent tech.
;;;   queries   : within-agent-vertical-reach (symmetric, for lifting),
;;;               within-agent-placement-reach (one-sided, for setting down)
;;;   function  : vertical-reach-limit-relevant-p -- conservative diagnostic for whether
;;;               manipulation or jumping has a structurally possible nonzero comparison
