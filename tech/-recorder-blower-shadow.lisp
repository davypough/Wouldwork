;;; Filename: -recorder-blower-shadow.lisp

;;; Recording-side state for the blower drives whose physics support recorder isolation:
;;; mountable wall gears, fixed wall blowers, and fixed floor blowers.  The fixed blower is
;;; not copied; ghost objects merely read this distinct activity state so playback-only
;;; activation cannot alter their recorded motion.
;;;
;;; Ghost-only control and jamming readings derive a distinct turning value, exposed
;;; through -recording-shadow-policy's turning-view hook.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested : -recorder-controls-shadow; -recorder-jamming-shadow;
;;;            -recording-shadow-policy (recording-shadow-turning neutral hook);
;;;            -propagation
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   relation : recording-turning
;;;   query    : recording-shadow-turning override
;;;   update   : update-recording-blower-status!
;;;   lifecycle: reset-recording-blower-shadow!
