;;; Filename: -vertical.lisp

;;; Vertical substrate: one model of where an object sits in the vertical dimension,
;;; replacing the role-branching elevation rules scattered across -elevation,
;;; -support-elevation, and beam-relay.  Three terms, of which only the first is stored:
;;;
;;;   height  --  an object's extent along its own axis, base to top.  A property of the
;;;               object, not of its orientation: a wall-repeater is a one-unit rod
;;;               however it is mounted, so its height is 1 like any other repeater's.
;;;   base    --  the absolute level of the object's lowest point.
;;;   top     --  base plus height when the object's axis is vertical, base alone when it
;;;               is not.  Computed, never stored.
;;;
;;; Base is structural rather than declared.  An object that rests on something derives
;;; its base from that support's top, following ON, then HOLDING, then HAS-LOCATION, then
;;; HAS-POSITION, bottoming out at a location's own level.  An object fixed in space has
;;; its base authored -- a location or apparatus through its point coordinates, a named
;;; segment through its shared endpoint z, and anything without coordinates through
;;; HAS-ELEVATION -- or defaulted by type.  No declaration distinguishes the resting case
;;; from the fixed one; the object's structure does.  "Anchor" is not a separate concept
;;; here: a beam anchor is always the anchoring object's TOP.
;;;
;;; The three achievable connector anchor heights fall out of this with no special case,
;;; measured from the floor the agent stands on: on the ground, base = floor and
;;; top = floor + 1; on a box, the box's top is floor + 1 so the connector's top is
;;; floor + 2; on a tray held by a standing agent, the agent's top is floor + 3/2, the
;;; zero-thickness tray's top is the same, and the connector's top is floor + 5/2.
;;;
;;; REQUIRES:
;;;   nested   : -height (has-height), -elevation (has-elevation), -location-coordinates
;;;              (location-coords>), -apparatus-coordinates (apparatus-coords>),
;;;              -segment-geometry (named segment coordinates),
;;;              -support-occupancy (on), -location (has-location), -position
;;;              (has-position), -holding (holding)
;;; PROVIDES:
;;;   types     : vertical-object  --  everything with a place in the vertical model
;;;   parameter : *vertical-type-constants*  --  per-type height default, axis, and
;;;               base default
;;;   queries   : base, top, fixed-base, object-height, location-elevation,
;;;               location-level
;;;
;;; LOCATION-ELEVATION is memoized, and that is only sound because a location's level
;;; is state-independent: a location is never ON anything, never held, and has no
;;; HAS-LOCATION or HAS-POSITION of its own, so all four of BASE's dynamic binds fail
;;; and it falls through to FIXED-BASE's static coordinate.  The memo therefore sits at
;;; a fixed entry point, and the overridable rule is the separate LOCATION-LEVEL seam:
;;; a technology redefines that one, and inherits the memo rather than displacing it.
;;; The contract a redefinition must keep is that LOCATION-LEVEL reads only static
;;; relations.  -floor-blowing's override does -- LOCATION-COORDS>, HAS-ELEVATION and
;;; AIMED-AT are all static.  One that read a dynamic relation would be served a stale
;;; value here, and would also invalidate -traversal's segment cache downstream.
;;;
;;; WALL-GEARS and WALL-BLOWER are deliberately absent from the table.  Their
;;; HAS-ELEVATION is a stream elevation read by -gears-fan's BLOWER-ELEVATION, not the
;;; base of a solid, and folding them in would give one relation two meanings again.

  "Per-type constants, in (TYPE HEIGHT-DEFAULT AXIS BASE-DEFAULT) form.  The axis says
   whether an object's height raises its top above its base: :VERTICAL does, :HORIZONTAL
   and :NONE do not.  The base default is where an object of that type sits when nothing
   says otherwise: 0 for anything standing on a floor, and 1 for wall-mounted apparatus,
   which hangs at about chest height.  That 1 is the same number APPARATUS-COORDS>
   registers as its third coordinate's default, for the same reason -- the relation lets a
   problem write the level inline, and this table supplies it when the problem carries no
   coordinates at all.  The types are disjoint leaves, so an object matches at most one
   entry and the order is presentational only.  A problem overrides a HEIGHTED-OBJECT's
   height with HAS-HEIGHT, and an ELEVATED-OBJECT's fixed base with coordinates or
   HAS-ELEVATION.  Other types intentionally keep the table's fixed height or derive their
   base structurally.
   A height on a non-vertical axis is DESCRIPTIVE ONLY: TOP ignores it, and every other
   OBJECT-HEIGHT consumer takes an argument type that admits no such object, so the number
   records the object's shape without entering any computation.  See repeater.lisp for the
   one instance -- a wall-repeater's projection from its wall -- and for why Phase 2
   declined to cross-check it against the coordinates.")
