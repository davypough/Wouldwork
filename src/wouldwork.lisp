;; --------------------- WOULDWORK (2024) Dave Brown <davypough@gmail.com> ----------------- ;;

INSTALLATION AND START:

      ;; when you git-cloned the respository, then you can manually load the asd file
      ;; to asdf
      (asdf:load-asd \"/path/to/wouldwork/wouldwork.asd\")
      ;; after that, you can (ql:quickload :wouldwork) without any problems.
      ;; you can place this to your personal .sbclrc file so that it asdf and quicklisp always
      ;; can recognize your package and its position in the system.

      (ql:quickload :wouldwork)  ;; install/load/import wouldwork package
      (in-package :wouldwork)    ;; enter the namespace
                                 ;; otherwise you need to prepone 'ww:' to your commands

ADD YOUR PROBLEM FOLDER:

      ;; the problem folder is in the package source folder 'src' in your quicklisp's local-folder
      ;; to see the exact location of your package, you can run:
      (ww::get-package-root :wouldwork)
      (get-src-folder-path)   ;; returns the exact location where you should place your
                                 ;; problem-<name>.lisp files - replace <name> by your problem name.

      ;; but if you want to add your problem files to a custom folder,
      ;; add them in this way:
      (add-problem-folder #P\"/path/to/your/folder/\")

      ;; this returns a list of all folder paths in which wouldwork will search for problem folders
      ;; this list of folders is saved in the global variable
      *problem-folder-paths*

      ;; to remove your custom folder, run:
      (remove-problem-folder #P\"/path/to/your/folder/\")

SOLVE PROBLEMS:

SOLVE A SINGLE PROBLEM:

      (list-all)

      ;; pick one of the listed problems, e.g. \"array-path\" and run (load and solve) the problem:

      (run \"array-path\")
