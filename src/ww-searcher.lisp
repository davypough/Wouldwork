;;; Filename:  ww-searcher.lisp

;;; Nonstandard Depth First Branch & Bound. Optional duplicate checking for nodes
;;; previously visited (graph search) as specified in problem spec. Open nodes are
;;; kept in an indexed stack and (optionally for graph search) visited nodes in a
;;; CLOSED hash table. Search
;;; follows the scheme described on p.55 of Problem Solving Methods in Artificial
;;; Intelligence by Nillson.
;;; A complete path from a goal to the start state is then available in OPEN.
;;; In graph search a visited node is
;;; either in OPEN or CLOSED at any particular time. A user-defined heuristic can be
;;; used to expand the best states first at each level (beam search), but
;;; the entire search graph may ultimately be searched (completeness).
