;;; Domain-independent h-max and landmark-cut propagation over a permissive abstract model.
;;; Technologies opt in by registering model builders; ordinary problems pay nothing.
;;; Static relaxed models can be compiled backward from their goals once, then reuse the
;;; resulting operator and current-fact slice for both evaluators at every search state.
;;; Repeated evaluation can also use integer fact/operator indexes, avoiding per-state hash
;;; indexes and allocated LM-cut justification arcs.
;;; Optional analysis records expose the same cuts without changing their cost partitioning.
;;; LM-cut follows Helmert and Domshlak's justification-graph cost partitioning: each round
;;; subtracts a positive disjunctive-landmark cut from residual operator costs.
