;;; Filename: ww-goal-chaining.lisp

;;; Generic ordered-milestone search.  User subgoals remain explicit; when a later
;;; milestone is exhaustively impossible from the selected checkpoint, this controller
;;; restarts the preceding milestone search while excluding only that exact checkpoint
;;; in the failed continuation context.  Problem technologies may register replay and
;;; lifecycle hooks, but checkpoint search, contextual nogoods, propagation, and undo
;;; remain generic planner facilities.

;;; Exhaustion is a proof only when the search actually explored its whole space.  A search
;;; the depth cutoff truncated -- one where a cut node still had successors -- reports
;;; :DEPTH-CUTOFF-TRUNCATED, rejects no checkpoint, and stops the recovery.  A cutoff that
;;; is merely too small therefore surfaces as a report to raise it, instead of an unbounded
;;; walk through every alternative predecessor state.
