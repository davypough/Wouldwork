;;; Recorder Stage 3 characterization.  Eight phase-gated physical occupancy transitions
;;; exercise two toggle plates -- CONTROL-PLATE, wired to the wall fan, and an
;;; independent CONTROL-PLATE-2 -- in both environmental views.  ON is bijective, so a
;;; support holds at most one direct occupant; a "first" agent presses CONTROL-PLATE,
;;; which alone drives the fan, while the corresponding "second" agent presses the
;;; independent CONTROL-PLATE-2, exercising the identical depressed/latched (and
;;; recording-side) mechanics on a second fixture without either plate displacing the
;;; other's occupant or the second plate's press/release ever perturbing the fan.  A
;;; parallel pressure plate with mapped box weights verifies ghost-only pressure output:
;;;
;;;   - live occupancy first turns on playback only, so a live box is swept while its
;;;     ghost copy remains and only the live actor sees the stream as impassable;
;;;   - pressing and releasing live-second on control-plate-2, and releasing live-first,
;;;     never perturb control-plate's own latch or the fan's turning;
;;;   - the first ghost occupancy then turns playback off but recording on, so a newly
;;;     introduced live box remains while the ghost box is swept and only the ghost sees
;;;     the stream as impassable;
;;;   - pressing and releasing ghost-second on control-plate-2, and releasing ghost-first,
;;;     likewise never perturb either view of the fan.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum path length: 8.
