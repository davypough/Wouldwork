;;; Filename: problem-recorder-isolation-test.lisp

;;; Zero-action characterization of recorder cross-layer isolation.  It exercises the
;;; installed generic pickup and connector actions in the initial state, inspects exact
;;; placement, jump-support, and physical-landing choices, and probes malformed initial
;;; HOLDING, ON, and PAIRED facts.  Recorder's private shadow components are included first
;;; to verify that nested-hook deduplication keeps their overrides in force when the shared
;;; action technologies are spliced later.
;;; Expected minimum path length: zero.
