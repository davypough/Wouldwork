;;; Filename: problem-box-test.lisp

;;;; Dedicated regression coverage for public box behavior.
;;;;
;;;; The three-action planning goal combines two independent lifecycles:
;;;;   1. pick up MOVING-BOX from SOURCE-BOX at the inclusive reach boundary,
;;;;      then put it on TARGET-BOX;
;;;;   2. put the already-held PLATE-BOX on PUT-PLATE, depressing the plate.
;;;;
;;;; The goal also characterizes action applicability without adding plan steps:
;;;; an occupied box cannot be picked up, a clear box just above vertical reach
;;;; cannot be picked up, an agent with a full hand cannot pick up another box,
;;;; and placement offers ground plus a clear box while excluding an occupied
;;;; box and an over-height location.
;;;;
;;;; Expected minimum path length: 3.
