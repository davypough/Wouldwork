;;; Recorder switch-state separation.  The test applies the real recorder and switch
;;; actions directly: ghost toggles affect only the recording shadow, live toggles affect
;;; only ordinary state, and closing a cycle reseeds the shadow from the live baseline.
;;; Expected harness path length: zero.
