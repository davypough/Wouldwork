;;; Filename: problem-control-test.lisp

;;; Control regression covering the shared DNF control substrate and gate behavior.
;;; Independent fixtures characterize:
;;;
;;;   1. Single normal and inverted controls in both energized states.
;;;   2. A two-controller AND clause at its exact all-on boundary.
;;;   3. Multiple OR clauses with a later true clause, and with no true clause.
;;;   4. The distinct empty-DNF boundaries: no clauses, versus one empty clause.
;;;   5. An uncontrolled gate, which defaults closed.
;;;   6. A jammed inverted gate, which stays open despite its control result.
;;;   7. ENERGIZED directly for depressed and clear plates and an inactive receiver.
;;;   8. A lifecycle pair sharing one plate: normal open/inverted closed initially,
;;;      then normal closed/inverted open after the sole action removes the weight.
;;;
;;; The goal is a characterization query over all stable fixtures and the lifecycle's
;;; final derived state.  Important absent facts are asserted explicitly: false control
;;; branches do not open their gates, the uncontrolled gate has no control declaration
;;; and remains closed, the clear plate and inactive receiver are not energized, and the
;;; released lifecycle plate is neither depressed nor energized.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum solution (1 step): RELEASE-LIFECYCLE-CONTROL.
