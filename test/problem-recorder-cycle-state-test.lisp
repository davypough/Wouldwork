;;; Filename: problem-recorder-cycle-state-test.lisp

;;; Focused characterization of planner-native recorder cycle state.  The test applies the
;;; real START-RECORDER and STOP-RECORDER actions to small states, without asking search to
;;; parse multiple windows (that is Stage 2).  It verifies count materialization, maximum
;;; enforcement, unrestricted-cycle operation, physical cross-layer boundary rejection,
;;; nonphysical cross-layer link removal, ghost disappearance, persistent ordinary latch
;;; state, recording-shadow reseeding, and a second clean fork from a changed live baseline.
;;; Expected ordinary harness path length: zero.
