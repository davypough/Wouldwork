;;; Filename: problem-recorder-cycle-boundary-test.lisp

;;; Zero-action characterization of closed recorder normalization.  The authored state has
;;; a latched, ghost-occupied toggle plate, one powered receiver/gate/gears lane, and one
;;; unpowered lane.  A synthetic STOP boundary removes that ghost state, then the fixture
;;; inverts every recording-shadow fact.  Preparation must leave the boundary untouched,
;;; copy it, seed the plate's stateful edge memory from the live baseline, and derive the
;;; remaining shadow.
;;; Expected minimum path length: zero.
