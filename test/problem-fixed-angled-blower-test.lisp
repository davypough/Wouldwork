;;; Filename: problem-fixed-angled-blower-test.lisp

;;; Fixed angled-blower regression.  Four independent units exercise the angled physics
;;; without removable mounted fans:
;;;
;;;   1. A stacked pair arcs onto a clear box whose explicitly raised top is accepted.
;;;   2. A box arcs to an elevated destination with no support and lands on bare ground.
;;;   3. A loose fan resting on a fixed blower is toppled in place rather than launched.
;;;   4. Clear plate1 drives a fixed blower through inverted control, launching its box
;;;      during initialization.  The one required configuration transition mounts plate1,
;;;      switching the blower off; the delivered box must remain at its destination.
;;;
;;; The goal also characterizes fixed-unit identity: each angled-blower is its own
;;; always-present drive and directly exposes the flush support surface from which
;;; occupants launch.  Expected minimum solution: one step onto PLATE1.
