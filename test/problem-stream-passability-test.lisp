;;; Filename: problem-stream-passability-test.lisp
;;;
;;; Dedicated regression coverage for coordinate-derived wall-stream passability.
;;;
;;; Two disconnected horizontal lanes each contain a wall-gears stream.  A solid
;;; cap continues each stream's upper side curtain exactly to the outer boundary,
;;; so the upper side zone can reach the destination only by crossing the stream.
;;; Coordinate derivation must therefore emit an unguarded directional ride into
;;; the destination and a gears-gated reverse route.  Routes crossing two curtains
;;; of one band must still name that gears only once.
;;;
;;; The lower fan is uncontrolled and remains blowing, characterizing the blocked
;;; ordinary crossings and the still-available inbound rides.  The upper fan is
;;; controlled by the plate under TEST-AGENT.  The required dismount transition clears
;;; that plate, stops the still-mounted fan, and makes every upper gears-gated route
;;; passable without changing any object's location.
;;;
;;; LOWER-GEARS uses the default stream width 3.  UPPER-GEARS overrides it with
;;; exact width 4, putting the tested side curtains at y=9/2 and y=11.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum path length: 1.
