;;; Filename: problem-reachability-coordinates-test.lisp
;;;
;;; Dedicated regression coverage for coordinate-derived manipulation reach.
;;;
;;; One rectangular boundary holds fifteen independent scenarios, each a pair of points
;;; two units apart and every scenario at least four units from its neighbours, so that
;;; *HORIZONTAL-REACH-LIMIT* can never join one scenario's points to another's and each
;;; assertion below characterizes exactly the geometry it names.
;;;
;;; The scenarios cover the whole rule: a clear in-range pair; the limit itself, met
;;; exactly and exceeded by a tenth; a wall that blocks and a window that does not; one
;;; gate crossed and two co-located gates crossed, the latter authored out of alphabetical
;;; order to pin the canonical barrier sort; a screen, which blocks outright because
;;; REACHABLE-CLEAR can never clear one; the ledge exception, reaching over an edge from
;;; the slab at its top while the same edge blocks a pair standing on the ground beside it;
;;; a gate whose vertical span floats entirely above the reach line and so is not a
;;; barrier; REACH-DISALLOWED> read in both directions; reach from a location to a
;;; wall-mounted switch; and two switches a single unit apart, between which no reach is
;;; ever derived because REACHABLE's second argument is always the actor's own location.
;;;
;;; AUTHORED-A and AUTHORED-B are in range and geometrically clear, so the derivation
;;; would emit an empty barrier list for them; the problem authors LOCKED-DOOR instead, and
;;; that authored list must survive untouched.  The derivation adds to a problem's reach
;;; facts and never restates or refines one.
;;;
;;; WALKABILITY is deliberately not included.  Reach derivation must stand on segment
;;; geometry alone, without the walking arrangement, and this file fails if it ever starts
;;; depending on it.
;;;
;;; The goal directly characterizes initialization-derived state; no action is needed.
;;; Expected minimum path length: 0.
