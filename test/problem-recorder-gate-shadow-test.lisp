;;; Filename: problem-recorder-gate-shadow-test.lisp

;;; Recorder gate-shadow characterization.  A four-step toggle sequence first establishes
;;; each direction of disagreement between the shared playback gate and the recording gate.
;;; Receiver-controlled gates simultaneously verify direct and relayed recording beams,
;;; that a live-only relay is absent from the recording view, and that a live-only beam
;;; blocker is absent there.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum path length: 4.
