;;; Zero-action characterization test for reachability.lisp.  Independent location pairs
;;; exercise:
;;;
;;;   1. Identity reachability for an isolated location.
;;;   2. A direct edge with no barriers, in both directions.
;;;   3. Direct edges guarded by one and two open gates.
;;;   4. A closed-gate edge and a mixed open/closed edge, both blocked in both directions.
;;;   5. Two adjacent direct edges whose endpoints remain mutually unreachable, proving
;;;      REACHABLE does not compute transitive closure.
;;;   6. Two disconnected locations that remain mutually unreachable.
;;;   7. REACHABLE-CLEAR directly recognizing open gates and rejecting a closed gate.
;;;
;;; OPEN-GATE1 and OPEN-GATE2 are seeded as dependency fixtures; CLOSED-GATE is deliberately
;;; absent from OPEN.  There are no actions or derived-state updates, so the initial state
;;; must satisfy every positive and negative assertion directly.  The expected minimum path
;;; length is therefore zero.
;;;
;;; This problem carries no segment geometry, so -REACHABILITY-COORDINATES' derivation is inert
;;; here and every REACH-VIA fact in the staged database is one authored below.  That inertness
;;; is the property this file guards: a problem that hand-authors its own reach must keep
;;; working exactly as it did before reach became derivable.  Do not add WALL-SEGMENT>,
;;; EDGE-SEGMENT>, or BOUNDARY-WALL to it -- any one of them arms the derivation and the guard
;;; is gone.
