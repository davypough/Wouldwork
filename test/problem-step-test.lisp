;;; Filename: problem-step-test.lisp

;;;; Dedicated regression coverage for public step behavior.
;;;;
;;;; Three independent actions are required:
;;;;   1. BOARDING-AGENT steps from ground onto BOARDING-PLATE.
;;;;   2. LEAVING-AGENT steps off LEAVING-PLATE onto ground.
;;;;   3. FAN-AGENT steps onto a clear gears-mounted floor fan.
;;;;
;;;; A characterization query verifies both lifecycles and directly checks that step
;;;; transition generation rejects an occupied plate, an already-supported agent, a remote
;;;; plate, a loose fan, a wall-mounted fan without a location, a box as a mount target,
;;;; and an agent attempting to dismount a box.  The mounted fan's normal control remains
;;;; clear, keeping its gears stopped so the fan occupancy can be observed directly.
;;;;
;;;; Expected minimum path length: 3.
