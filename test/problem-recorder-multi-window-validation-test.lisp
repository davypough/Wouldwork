;;; Filename: problem-recorder-multi-window-validation-test.lisp

;;; Focused Stage 2/3/4 characterization of the integrated-path state machine, boundary
;;; identity.  Completed
;;; cycles are separated by real STOP/START transitions.  Between them the live box moves,
;;; so the next isolated recording succeeds only when its snapshot is reconstructed through
;;; the preceding normalized boundary and its fresh ghost fork.  The fixture also proves
;;; that an integrated stop can be physically legal while its recording is invalid, and
;;; that mandatory boundary validation rejects that successor before graph insertion.
;;; Stage 3 additionally proves no-progress rejection and the separate Pareto rule under
;;; which an equal-or-cheaper normalized boundary with fewer cycles dominates one with more
;;; cycles while open states, physical differences, and cost/resource tradeoffs remain.
;;; Stage 4 reconstructs complete one-, two-, and three-cycle reports from accepted paths.
;;; Expected ordinary harness path length: zero.
