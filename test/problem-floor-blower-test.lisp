;;; Filename: problem-floor-blower-test.lisp

;;; Fixed floor-blower regression.  Three independent units exercise the shared
;;; floor-directed physics without a removable mounted fan:
;;;
;;;   1. An uncontrolled fixed blower launches BOX1 to LOFT1 and carries BOX2 with it
;;;      still stacked.  The stream remains active, sustaining the unsupported stack.
;;;   2. A loose fan resting on another uncontrolled fixed blower is too flat to launch;
;;;      it is toppled onto the source location's ground instead.
;;;   3. A plate-controlled fixed blower starts off, so an unsupported box at its
;;;      destination drops back to the blower's source.
;;;
;;; The zero-action goal also characterizes fixed-unit identity: each floor-blower is its
;;; own drive, needs no mounted fan to be present, and exposes the same flush support
;;; surface from which occupants launch.
