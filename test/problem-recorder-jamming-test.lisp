;;; Filename: problem-recorder-jamming-test.lisp

;;; Recorder jamming characterization.  Four dedicated jammers must establish the two
;;; environmental views for each supported target kind:
;;;
;;;   - a live jammer opens an ordinary gate but not its recording shadow;
;;;   - a ghost jammer opens both ordinary and recording gate state;
;;;   - a live jammer stops ordinary wall gears while recording gears keep turning;
;;;   - a ghost jammer stops both ordinary and recording wall-gears state.
;;;
;;; A separate live-only plate opens an intervening sight gate during playback.  Untouched
;;; mapped live/ghost probe actors keep equivalent JAM-TARGET requests available at the goal:
;;; the live request sees the playback gate as open, while the ghost request sees its closed
;;; recording shadow and is inapplicable.  Expected minimum path length: four.
