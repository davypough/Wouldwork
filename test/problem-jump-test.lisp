;;; Filename: problem-jump-test.lisp

;;; Combined stageable regression for jump.lisp.  Six independent planning lanes exercise:
;;;
;;;   1. An agent mounts a box exactly at the fixed jump-elevation limit, then clears a wall
;;;      from the box top, itself exactly at the same fixed limit above that raised launch
;;;      point.  The directed jump lands on ground and removes the launch-box support.
;;;   2. An agent already on a box drops to local ground without changing location.
;;;   3. An agent crosses a symmetric edge in the reverse authored direction and lands
;;;      directly from one height-4 box onto another.  A ground landing cannot later reach
;;;      the destination box, so the direct box-landing branch is required.
;;;   4. An agent carries a box through a stairs-then-jump mobility route in one MOVE.  The
;;;      stairs raise the hypothetical jump source from elevation 0 to 2.  The jump then
;;;      rises exactly the fixed jump-elevation limit to elevation 3 and clears two barriers
;;;      from that same hypothetical source -- one comfortably under the limit, one exactly
;;;      at it.
;;;   5. A grounded agent jumps directly onto a remote clear box, exercising the remaining
;;;      ground-to-support configuration boundary.
;;;   6. A grounded agent jumps directly onto a remote tray held by another agent.  The
;;;      tray's top follows its holder and sits exactly at the fixed elevation limit.
;;;
;;; Independent stationary probes characterize the public clearance queries and inspect
;;; MOVE's and CHANGE-CONFIGURATION's real generated children.  They verify inclusive and
;;; just-over elevation boundaries -- JUMP-ELEVATION-REACHABLE's raised-landing bound and
;;; JUMP-PATH-CLEAR's vaulting bound share the same fixed *vertical-reach-limit*, and
;;; neither consults any agent's declared height -- downward freedom, barrier defaults and
;;; explicit overrides, highest-feature selection, empty-handed screen passability,
;;; directed-edge asymmetry, rejection of an unsafe landing, rejection of an occupied box
;;; top while preserving its ground landing, rejection of an over-limit local box mount,
;;; exclusive ownership of grounded jumps by mobility rather than the configuration-
;;; transition substrate, and rejection of an edge instance from a jumping TRAVERSE-VIA
;;; feature list --
;;; VAULTABLE-OBJECT deliberately excludes edge, since an edge has no independent "top" to
;;; vault onto.  The move-type tag itself is also characterized: a genuinely vaulting
;;; transition (lane 4) is tagged VAULT, while a non-empty but fully passable feature list
;;; (the remote-mount canonicalization contract below) still tags JUMP.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum solution (7 steps, in any interleaving): mount vault-box; cross
;;; vault-start -> vault-goal; drop from drop-box; cross transfer-start -> transfer-goal
;;; directly onto transfer-target-box; move carry-approach -> carry-goal through stairs and
;;; jump segments while holding carried-box; jump from remote-mount-start directly onto
;;; remote-target-box; jump from remote-tray-start directly onto remote-held-tray.
