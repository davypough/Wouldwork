;;; Filename: problem-walkability-compound-door-test.lisp
;;;
;;; Coordinate-derived walking through co-located gates and screens.  Two full-height
;;; partitions each contain one doorway occupied by both fixtures.  The first gate is
;;; open: an empty-handed agent crosses, while an agent holding cargo cannot pass its
;;; screen.  The second gate is closed: its screen alone cannot permit the empty-handed
;;; agent through.  Exact traversal families prove each interval contributes one
;;; conjunctive clause rather than two alternative doors.
;;;
;;; A direct classifier probe retains the separate rule that a directional stream
;;; curtain cannot share an interval with an ordinary hard door.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum path length: 0.
