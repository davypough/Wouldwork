;;; Filename: problem-walkability-coordinates-test.lisp
;;;
;;; Dedicated regression coverage for coordinate-derived walking topology.
;;;
;;; A rectangular boundary contains three zones separated by full-height partitions.
;;; The first partition has two alternative gates; the second has a gate or screen.
;;; Exact walking TRAVERSE-VIA families characterize same-zone connectivity, each
;;; partition, and the four canonical two-obstacle routes across both partitions.  The
;;; partitions terminate exactly on the boundary, so any endpoint leak changes those
;;; families.
;;;
;;; A room sealed by two walls, one edge, and one window must remain disconnected --
;;; proving EDGE-SEGMENT> seals a zone exactly like WALL-SEGMENT> does.  A gate begins
;;; exactly at that edge's top and shares its XY interval; the arrangement accepts the
;;; supported upper doorway while retaining the edge as a planar walking solid.  Two further
;;; locations exercise valid placement exactly on an uncovered induced grid line and
;;; at an unambiguous induced grid vertex.  A loft shares LEFT-START's x/y coordinates
;;; but remains a distinct, non-walkable location because its elevation is five.  With
;;; only GATE-A open, an empty-handed agent crosses the second partition through SCREEN-A,
;;; while a holding agent cannot.
;;; A direct geometry probe confirms that the rectangular-cell derivation preserves
;;; the shared BOUNDARY-WALL axis-alignment invariant internally.
;;;
;;; The goal directly characterizes initialization-derived state; no action is needed.
;;; Expected minimum path length: 0.
