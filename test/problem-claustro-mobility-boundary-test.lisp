;;; Filename: problem-claustro-mobility-boundary-test.lisp

;;; Focused reproduction of Claustro's raised-slab boundary.  The ordinary lane requires
;;; three actions: mount BOX2 at LOCATION10, jump from that support to raised LOCATION12,
;;; then traverse LOCATION12 -> LOCATION13 -> LOCATION11 through one grounded MOVE.  The
;;; first two changes are explicit configuration transitions; only the final walk/jump
;;; route is transparent mobility.
;;;
;;; Independent probes preserve Claustro's one-way empty-handed ladder and demonstrate the
;;; intentional stairs variant: stairs from elevation 0 to 2 bypass the box and compose
;;; with the same raised walk/downward-jump route in one MOVE.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum path length: 3.
