;;; Filename: problem-recorder-two-cycle-test.lisp

;;; Executable planner-native and guided two-cycle recorder characterization.  Cycle 1
;;; requires genuine live/ghost cooperation: the ghost primes a transient opportunity and
;;; the live agent consumes it while pressing a toggle plate.  The priming fact is gone at
;;; the boundary, so the persistent advance is the latch produced by both sides rather than
;;; an ordinary setup action.  STOP preserves that latch, removes ghosts, seeds
;;; RECORDING-LATCHED from the committed live baseline, and derives RECORDING-OPEN.  Cycle 2
;;; then starts from the normalized boundary and its freshly forked ghost uses the recording
;;; gate.  A single integrated window cannot validate the same actions: isolated recording
;;; replay omits the live press and therefore sees the original closed recording gate.
;;; With a maximum of one cycle there is no solution through depth seven; with two, one
;;; ordinary SOLVE finds the unique seven-action path.  Recorder-aware subgoaling instead
;;; checkpoints the open first cycle after three actions, then transparently closes it and
;;; enters the second cycle while pursuing the final goal.  The
;;; ordinary Talos harness goal is deliberately zero-action: the characterization claim
;;; installs the non-flattenable final goal while it exercises the chained solver, then
;;; restores the harness goal before TEST-TALOS performs its required ordinary search.
