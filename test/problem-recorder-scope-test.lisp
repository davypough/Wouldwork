;;; Filename: problem-recorder-scope-test.lisp

;;; Zero-action characterization of the recorder's supported recording-shadow boundary.
;;; The staged problem is a supported fixed wall-blower configuration.  Direct validation
;;; probes then install one unsupported optional capability at a time and verify that each
;;; fails at recorder initialization rather than acquiring approximate playback physics.
;;; Expected minimum path length: zero.
