;;; Filename: problem-jammer-test.lisp

;;; Dedicated jammer regression for the target and support branches not directly
;;; covered by the gun tests.  Four isolated lanes require:
;;;
;;;   1. JAM-TARGET against a gate through LOS-VIA, choosing a plate
;;;      placement so the retained jam both depresses the plate and opens the gate.
;;;   2. JAM-TARGET against wall gears from a distinct visible vantage, resolving
;;;      sight through the gears' HAS-POSITION location and stopping the gears.
;;;   3. JAM-TARGET against floor gears at their exact HAS-POSITION location,
;;;      succeeding without any authored LOS fact and stopping the gears.
;;;   4. PICKUP-JAMMER remotely retrieving a jammer that rests on a plate and
;;;      suppresses wall gears.  Pickup must clear location, support, and jamming;
;;;      propagation must clear the plate and restart the fixed wall blower.
;;;
;;; The first three agents begin holding their dedicated jammers so each positive
;;; targeting branch requires exactly one action.  The lifecycle agent begins
;;; empty-handed and requires exactly one pickup.  The four lanes have disconnected
;;; manipulation topology and exact target assertions, so no action can satisfy
;;; another lane.  Expected minimum path length: four actions, in any order.
