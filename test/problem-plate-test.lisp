;;; Filename: problem-plate-test.lisp

;;; Dedicated zero-action regression for public plate behavior.  Seven independent
;;; fixtures characterize the complete derived invariant:
;;;
;;;   DEPRESSED(?plate) iff some SUPPORT-OCCUPANT rests ON ?plate.
;;;
;;; Five plates begin occupied by the five support-occupant leaf types: agent, box,
;;; jammer, connector, and fan.  Their DEPRESSED facts are omitted so initialization
;;; must derive them.  The test initialization action injects a stale DEPRESSED fact for
;;; a sixth, clear plate immediately before propagation, which must retract it.  A seventh
;;; plate begins clear and undepressed, checking the already-consistent negative case.
;;;
;;; The goal directly verifies every ON fact, exact single-support ownership, SUPPORT-OCCUPIED,
;;; and DEPRESSED result after the ordinary propagation init action.  No manipulation
;;; action is involved because normalization of the derived plate state is the behavior
;;; under test.  Expected minimum path length: zero.
