;;; Filename: problem-beam-relay-test.lisp

;;; Dedicated connector-action regression for beam-relay.lisp.  The required lifecycle
;;; and independent characterization fixtures exercise:
;;;
;;;   1. PICKUP-CONNECTOR removing its support occupancy, its outgoing pairing, and a
;;;      reverse-oriented pairing where another connector names it as terminus.
;;;   2. CONNECT-CONNECTOR selecting exactly two useful termini from three structurally
;;;      eligible choices at *MAX-CONNECTOR-PAIRINGS* = 2, then propagating color to a receiver.
;;;   3. PUT-CONNECTOR placing an independently held connector on a plate without pairings.
;;;   4. CONNECTABLE-LOCATION rejecting a site occupied by a lit connector while accepting
;;;      sites occupied only by unlit connectors.
;;;   5. CONNECTABLE-TERMINUS using structural visibility: a transmitter behind a closed
;;;      gate is eligible for pairing but not live visibility.  A no-LOS transmitter, the
;;;      connector itself, and a connector already at the placement location are rejected.
;;;
;;; Initial state: lifecycle-connector rests on old-plate at origin, paired outward to
;;; old-source and named inward by incoming-connector; placement-connector is held by
;;; put-agent; lit-blocker-connector is green; the lifecycle receiver is inactive.
;;;
;;; Final state: lifecycle-connector is on bare ground at target, paired only to new-source
;;; and new-receiver, red, and activating new-receiver.  old-plate is clear.  The old,
;;; incoming, decoy, self, and other unintended pairings remain absent.
;;; placement-connector rests unpaired and unlit on put-plate, depressing it.
;;;
;;; Expected minimum solution (3 steps): PICKUP-CONNECTOR and CONNECT-CONNECTOR for the
;;; lifecycle fixture, plus PUT-CONNECTOR for the independent fixture.  The put may occur
;;; anywhere relative to the two ordered lifecycle actions.
